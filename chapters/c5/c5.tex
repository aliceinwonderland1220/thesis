\chapter{Physcis Objects}

\label{ch:objects}
This chapter introduced the physics objects used in this thesis in the reconstruction of events. 
Boosted Higgs reconstruction is described in depth as several new techniques have been developed.
 The reconstruction of primary vertices is described in Section~\ref{sec:pv}. 
Different types of jets that are used by this analysis in different kinematic regions are described in Section~\ref{sec:jets}. 
The reconstruction of electrons and muons are described in Section~\ref{sec:el} in Section~\ref{sec:mu}. 
Taus, which are also reconstructed as jets, are described in Section~\ref{sec:tau}. 
The reconstruction of missing transverse energy, or $E_T^{Miss}$, is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:met} 
and the missing transverse energy significance definitions are described in Section~\ref{sec:me_sig}. 
Finally Higgs tagging is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:higgs}.
