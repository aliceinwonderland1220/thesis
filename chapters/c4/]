\chapter{The ATLAS experiment}

\label{ch:atlas}
ATLAS( (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of the major experiments located at Point 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is a general-purpose particle physics experiment, which is designed to exploit the huge range of physics opportunities that the LHC provides. 		Located at 92 m below ground, ATLAS has a cylinder shape which has a length of  46 m, a diameter of 25 m and a weight of over 7000 tons.  The experiment is a collaboration involving roughly 3,000 physicists from over 175 institutions in 38 countries\cite{fact}.
A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used in this thesis: the coordinate origin is at the geometric center of the ATLAS detector, with a z-axis as the direction of beam pipe.
 The x-y plane is perpendicular to the z-axis, with x pointing from origin point to the center 
of LHC ring and y pointing upward. Therefore, polar angle $\theta$ is measured with respect to z-axis and azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured around the beam axis. 
The pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta = ln tan(\frac{\theta}{2})$. The distance $\Delta R$ in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal plane is defined as 
$\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta\eta^2 + \Delta\phi^2}$. Transverse momentum $P_T$, transverse energy $E_T$ and missing transverse energy $E_T^{miss}$ are all defined in x-y plane.

A cut-away view of ATLAS detector is showed in~\ref{fig:atlas}. 
The four major components of the ATLAS detector are the Inner Detector, the Calorimeter, the Muon Spectrometer, and the Magnet System. Integrated with the detector components are: the Trigger and Data Acquisition System, a specialized multi-level computing system, which selects physics events with distinguishing characteristics; and the Computing System, which develops and improves computing software used to store, process and analyze vast amounts of collision data at 130 computing centers worldwide\cite{atlas}.
