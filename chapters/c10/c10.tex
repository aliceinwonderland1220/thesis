\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\par The discovery of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV is a major milestone in our understanding of the standard model.
Because of the large predicted branching fraction for the $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ decay ($\sim 58\%$), 
its coupling to b quarks is a very interesting topic to study.
\par With a Higgs boson \pt~above about 250 GeV (\pt$ = \frac{2m}{\Delta R}$), the two b quark jets merge into a single jet for a jet cone size of R = 1 and the approach of Higgs boson reconstruction 
in this topology is different than using two individual smaller-R jets separately. The decaying object is reconstructed within a fatjet. 
The previous chapter shows studies that explored $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ tagging algorithms using their ghost-associated subjets, 
though we believe the optimal performance comes from using both the substructure information of the fatjet as well as the track and vertex information related to the b hadron lifetime. 
\par The approach presented here utilizes both the jet substructure and the b tagging information from the bb pair within the same fatjet.

\par A universal boosted Xbb tagger is built by avoiding a strong performance dependency on the fat jet \pt~and mass. As a result, 
the tagger could be used in many different topologies and kinematical regimes, such as searches for the H boson in ttH, VH and VBF production modes, 
resonant HH and VH production, t' and b' in the tH and bH final states. The boosted Higgs tagger is also essential for this thesis - searches for boosted mono-H. 
In principle, the algorithm should also be able to identify $Z\rightarrow b\bar{b}$, as well as any hypothetical particle decaying into a $b\bar{b}$ pair with a mass close to the W/Z/H boson.
\section{Monte Carlo Simulation Samples}
\label{sec:mc}
\par A sample of background jets initiated by light quarks and gluons is derived from a multijet process simulated using PYTHIA8~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} with the NNPDF2.3 leading order (LO) parton distribution
 function (PDF) set~\cite{Ball:2012cx} and the A14~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} tuned modelling of showering and underlying event parameterisations. 
Jets from this sample are referred to as QCD jets. Fully hadronic top quark pair events are used for jets originating from hadronic top quark decays (top jets) and are generated 
using POWHEG~\cite{Frixione:2007vw}~\cite{Nason:2004rx} interfaced to PYTHIA6~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} with the PERUGIA 2012~\cite{Skands:2010ak} underlying event tune parameter set 
and the four flavor scheme of the CT10 PDF set ~\cite{Gao:2013xoa}.
\par For the boosted Higgs jets, a sample of high \pt~Higgs bosons is obtained from the BSM physics simulation of a Randall-Sundrum graviton decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons with both Higgs bosons 
subsequently decaying to $b\bar{b}$ pairs ($g\rightarrow HH \rightarrow bbbb$) ~\cite{Randall:1999ee}and the Higgs boson mass = 125GeV. This process is generated using MadGraph5~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} 
interfaced with PYTHIA8 and with the ATLAS A14 tune, and NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set. The mass splitting between the massive graviton and the Higgs bosons provides a boost proportional to the mass of the guon. 
Therefore, signal samples have been generated with graviton masses between 300 GeV and 6000 GeV to fully populate the kinematic region of interest. 
The signal samples of various masses are merged and both top samples and singal samples are reweighted on a jet-by-jet basis such that the large-R calorimeter jet kinematics in \pt~and $\eta$ 
in signal matches that of the QCD jet sample. 
This reweighting is intended to mitigate the effects of any difference imposed on account of kinematic changes present between the unweighted samples. 
EvtGen~\cite{Lange:2001uf} is used in samples modeling the decays of b- and c-flavoured hadrons.
\par The Monte Carlo samples are processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation~\cite{Aad:2010ah} with the tool Geant4~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}. 

\section{Double-b tagger algorithm}
\label{sec:algo}
\par As showed in the Chapter~\ref{ch:objects}, the previous approach requires declustering the fatjet which are used to reconstruct Higgs boson with two subjets with one of these following types: fixed radius track jets, various radius track jet, exclusive-kT (ExKt) or Center-of- Mass (CoM) calorimeter jets.	
\par The standard single-b tagging algorithms is applied to the subjets, which takes advantage of the tracking and vertexing information and are designed to identify subjets from single b quarks. With its focus on individual subjets, the subjet single-b tagging does not make use of the global properties of the fatjets which contain two b hadrons. Even though the algorithm performs well in the high purity regime relying heavily on the reconstruction of secondary vertices associated with the subjets, at high \pt, the subjets start to overlap and cause the standard single b tagging techniques to break down due to double-counting of tracks and secondary vertices when computing the subjet single b-tagging discriminants. 
\par To discriminate bb originated from Higgs from QCD jets initiated by single partons, a boosted Higgs tagger with large signal-to-background ratio is achieved via a deep neural network (DNN) which fully exploits the presence of two b quarks inside a fat jet and their topology in relation to the jet substructure. 

\subsection{Input features}

\par The input feed into the neural networks are both features of the subjets declustered from the fatjet and features that describes the correlation between the subjets.
\par For each subjet,
\begin{itemize}


\item To reconstruct b hadron decay vertices, we apply the Inclusive Second Vertex (SV1) algorithm from the previous chapter which identifies secondary vertices independently of the jet clustering. 
\item We reconstruct the decay chains of the two b hadrons by associating reconstructed secondary vertices to the subjet axis via JetFitter from the previous chapter. 		 
\item Output scores of two algorithm, IP3D/IP2D (using likelihood-ratio method) and RNNIP (using recurrent neural network) which processes charged particle tracks associated to jets without reliance on secondary 
    vertex finding can also augment secondary-vertex based taggers. 
\end{itemize}


\par Similar to the single-b tagger (MV2c10), the scores from these low-level taggers are all feed into the neural network to complement each others’ performance.

All input features constructed within each subjets that are used for the training are listed in Table~\ref{tab:input}.

\caption{Input features used for training double-b tagger.}
\label{tab:input}

\end{table}

\par Besides, the following features are used to describe the correlations:
\begin{itemize}


\item Subjet kinematic variables: \pt~and $\eta$.
\item Subjet angular variables: $d R$, $d\eta$, $d\phi$ with respect to the parent fatjet.
\item Event-based variables: \pt~imbalance between subjets which indicates the ratio of each subjet momentum to the total momentum.
\end{itemize}




\section{Neural network architecture}
\label{sec:dnn}
A feed-forward, fully connected neural network~\cite{hopfield1982neural} with 6 hidden layers, 164 input features and 2 or 3 outputs is designed. While a batch normalization layer is applied at the input layer, each hidden layer of the neural network is built from the following components: 
\begin{itemize}


\item Dense layer: defined as a linear combination of all outputs from the previous layer. 
\item Batch normalization layer: to transform the inputs to zero-mean and unit-variance. ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/IoffeS15}
\item Dropout layer: an operation that drops a fixed fraction of randomly chosen nodes, used as a regularization handle. The dropout rate is one of the optimized hyperparameters of the neural network.~\cite{JMLR:v15:srivastava14a}
\item Activation unit: we use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)~\cite{inproceedings} in Equation~\ref{eq:relu}:	
\end{itemize}				
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \left \{ \begin{array}{rcl}
0 & \mbox{for} & x < 0\\ x & \mbox{for} & x \ge 0\end{array} \right. \label{eq:relu}
\end{equation}
			
			
To optimize the performance of the neural network, three hyperparameters are considered: the depth of the network architecture, the dropout rate and the learning rate. The following values are considered:



\begin{itemize}


\item Dropout rate: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5;
\item Number of hidden layers: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7;
\item Learning rate: $10^{−1}$, $10^{−2}$, $10^{−3}$, $10^{−4}$, $10^{−5}$.
\end{itemize}		
\par Out of 125 grid points in the hyperparameter space, 50 combinations are randomly sampled. From all the configurations with comparable performance, 
the network with the smallest number of trainable parameters was chosen. 
\par We start with learning rate = 0.1 and uses an adaptive learning rate which means decreasing the learning rate by a factor of three once the performance of the model plateaus. Also, early stopping~\cite{Yao07onearly} which allows 20 training epochs and stop training once the model performance stops improving on a hold out validation dataset are also applied as regularization. 

\section{Signal efficiency and Background mistag rate measurement}
\label{sec:per}

\par Both signal efficiency and background mistag rate of the double-b tagger are evaluated with the testing samples which comes from the same distribution but independent of the training samples.


\par Performances of these following taggers are evaluated: DL-tag refers to a bi-class discriminator that distinguishes QCD from Higgs with input features from each subjet, and subjet correlation. 
XbbScore is a multiclass discriminator(QCD, Higgs, Top) which also includes other fatjet substructure features in the input features. 
The baseline boosted Hbb taggers, which identify a fatjet with two ghost-associated track jets (2-tag) or one b-tagged track jet (1-tag leading jet), are used for comparison.


\par The performance can be expressed in terms of its receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot, which shows the change of background rejection as a function of the Higgs efficiency. Fig~\ref{fig:xbb_roc} (left) compares double-b taggers with the baseline boosted Higgs tagger while the right plot compares XbbScore which trains Hbb against QCD and top jet with a top tagger built on neural network and the jet substructure variable $\tau_{32}$.
\par In general, double-b tagger outperforms the baseline boosted Hbb and top tagger. At the same signal efficiency, the mistag rate of the new method is uniformly lowered by about a factor of 2 to 5.

 \caption{ROC plot: Comparison between Hbb taggers (Left) and Top taggers (right)}
 \label{fig:xbb_roc}

\end{figure}
\par In Fig.~\ref{fig:xbb_pt}, the signal efficiencies and mistag rates for the double-b tagger as a function of fatjet \pt are reported with the basline boosted Hbb tagger as comparisons.


\par The left plot shows the Higgs efficiency for a fixed 70\% working point (WP) cut as a function of fatjet \pt. To isolate the effect of a changing Higgs efficiency from that of the changing 
dijets rejection, the right plot shows a flat-efficiency 70\% WP, which means all taggers have a 70\% efficiency across \pt~and only the rejection is varying. The mistag rate is relatively flat across the 
\pt~range, while the signal efficiency decreases with increasing \pt, as expected from the deregradation of the tracking performance inside high \pt~jets. 
Again, double-b tagger outperforms the baseline boosted Hbb tagger.
