This work presents the search for Dark Matter particles associated with the Higgs Boson decaying into a $b\bar{b}$ quark pair. 
The dark matter search result is based on proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector during Run II. 
Two simplified models, as dark matter theory candidates in particle physics, are the target of searching with collision data. 
The new powerful Higgs tagging techniques, which exploit the jet substructure and heavy flavor information to a large extent, are developed to improve the search sensitivity of the search. 
The target physics signals are signature with an optimized search region and interpreted with background estimation result statistically.
