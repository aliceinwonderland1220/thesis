This work presents the search for Dark Matter particles associated with the Higgs Boson decaying into a $b\bar{b}$ quark pair. 
The dark matter search result is based on proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector during Run II with an integrated luminosity of 160 $fb^{-1}$. 
Two simplified models, as dark matter theory candidate in particle physics, are the target of searching with collision data. 
The new powerful Higgs tagging techniques, which exploits the jet substructure and heavy flavor information on large extent, are developed to improve the search sensitivity of the search. 
The target physics signals are signatured with optimized search region, and interpreted with background estimation result in the statistical manner.
