This work presents a search for Dark Matter particles associated with the Higgs Boson decaying into a $b\bar{b}$ quark pair. We use  
proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector during Run II with an integrated luminosity of 160 fb$^{-1}$.
Two simplified model are used to interpret the result. In order to enhance search sensitivity in 
particular to boosted Higgs boson and suppress the dominant multijet/top backgrounds, we introduce a new powerful Higgs tagging techniques which fully exploits the jet substructure and heavy flavor information. 
 In the absence of an excess, upper limits on the production cross section are set with 95\% confidence level.
%The observed data are found to be consistent with the expected Standard Model backgrounds.
